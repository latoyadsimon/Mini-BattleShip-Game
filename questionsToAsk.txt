I have completed part 1.

Part 2 questions:

I have figured out how to make a grid function that takes a number as an argument to produce my grid with that number, and the letters to "essentially" make a square.

----gridBuilder(10);// returns a grid with a1 - j10. ----

*I can not figure out how to make the multi unit ships that does not defy the logic of the grid:

ex. of what im returning:
[
  [ 'b5', 'b6' ],
  [ 'c7', 'c8', 'c9' ],
  [ 'h8', 'h9', 'h10' ],
  [ 'b5', 'b6', 'b7', 'b8' ],//it also repeats
  [ 'f9', 'f10', 'g1', 'g2', 'g3' ]//f10, end of board
]

------
*I do not understand how to make the random placements vertical and horizontal of the ships.
---solved minimally
//idea for ship vertical horizontal
// one array with two arrays
//array[0] has all letters that are the same ex:
a1, a2, a3
//array[1] has all numbers, ex:
a1, b1, c1
//function to make the vertical and horizontal array
//randomizer to choose vertical or horizontal
// then function to randomly choose the first space
//validate that the ship does not go beyond the edges
//push to the randomArray

----was able to make a vertical and horizontal array
---stopped a bit of the repeating as well.

notes to save for later:
some unicode symbols
//a cow
var str = '\uD83D\uDC04';
console.log(str)

var Omega = '\u03A9';
console.log(Omega)

let square = "\u22A1";
console.log(square)
